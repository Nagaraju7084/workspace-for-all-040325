@OneToMany - limitation

third table will be generated in between the two tables / classes

UserRole and UserPermissions => two tables
UserRole_UserPermission => third table

doctorId 	permId(unique)
1 				view
1 				edit
1 				delete
2				view(not possible) always have unique attribute, throws uniqueidentifier exception

normal forms :
second normal form is a table should not contains multi valued attributes
ex :
Role table :
id roleId permId name
1  1      1      admin
1  1      2      admin
1  1      3      admin

its voilation of second normal form

RoleToPermission
doctorId 		permId		id(unique)
1 				view		1
1 				edit		2
1 				delete		3
2				view		4
