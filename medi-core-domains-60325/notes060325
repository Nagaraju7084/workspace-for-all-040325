Q).mediuser entity doesn't have password then will mediauthentication filled up with the username and password?
A).in two cases it will be filled up with username and password
1.user will be created by the administrator
2.email will be trigger with the confirmation link that link will be saved in the cache for a period
the user will click on the confirmation link from the email
3.user will get activated when user will click on the confirmation link
4.when user entered the password, confirm password then authentication table will be updated with
the username, password
this authentication table can referred later on time for the authentication when the user clicking
on the authentication link / login button then the username, password the user entered always those entered
username, password should have to check with this authentication table

we will make onetoone relation to the authentication table with the userinfo / user table
if the user will disabled after sometime then the user shouldn't be loggedin so we have to
check these two flags i.e. isUserExisted and isUserActivated when authentication will happen

in case any of the time the user was locked because of password wrong attempts might he did 3 attempts
so account was locked, later when he will be tring to access after one hour or one day account
shouldn't be loggedin until the user has to do a forgot password or reset the password or send an email
to backend team to unlock / enable the account
that time email will be triggered to the user with the change password link
when the change password done successfully, we should have to activated the user


user will be in the locked / disabled status, email will be triggered when the email will be
verified then user will get activated i.e. status in mediuser table is true

Q).when user will be created and when the user will be activated?
