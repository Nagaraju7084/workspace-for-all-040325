#if we want intialize datasource always regardless of its type
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
spring.datasource.data=classpath:schema.sql
note : -(hyphen) are not allowed in the schema.sql script ex : medi-jwt-service040325 -> not allowed rather, we should use _(underscore)
i.e. medi_jwt_service040325 -> this is allowed

we inserted the permissions through schema.sql script but once after user is created
that permissions should have to map
this(permission, role, roletopermission data insertion has done through schema.sql script)data we should have to enter the user
user1 who is going to creating should have the permissions 1 to 4
user2 who is going to creating should have the permissions 1 to 4

before creating the user first insert the data into the usertype table as
id usertype
1  Admin
2  Doctor
3  Patient
create the user1 and user2 via swagger
